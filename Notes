Things I want to do:
- Define rating schema for properties and Landlords
	- Implement in model
	- Create serializers
	- Link in API endpoints
		- Should these be edittable?
		- Should they be accessible independently?
- Create authentication system
- Create functions that return averages for properties and landlords
- Want to add monthly rent field
- Add optional Company field for landlord (for management companies)
- Add number of occupants to property model
* Tags so they can quickly assign properties to LandLords or Props

- Landlord ratings
	- Communication
	- Responsibility
	- 
- Property Ratings
	- Condition
	- Location?
	- 


Property general information, calculated reviews, Love, Hate

Using Directives:
- homeCtrl will be the main scope
- maps and cards (and list?) will be created using directives
- Directives will take in all necessary info from homectrl with scope
	<myapp-contestant-editor-form contestants="ctrl.contestants">
    	</myapp-contestant-editor-form>
- MapsControl Directive:
	- Needs to be passed to Home: coordinates of screen
	- Needs to be aware of: properties

HomeCtrl:
//These are the current properties, if you are viewing by landlord this is set to the 
properties that the landlord owns, if you are viewing by property this is the properties that
are in view (later AND the ones that match any filters)
vm.currProps;

//The currently selected landlord, this gets set when you are viewing a property to the owner
of that property or if you are viewing by landlord it is the one you selected
vm.currLandlord;
